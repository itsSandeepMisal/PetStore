This is an example of the HTTP integration type. The URL of the integration endpoint is http://petstore-demo-endpoint.execute-api.com/petstore/pets. POST /pets: for write access to the API's /pets resource that is integrated with the backend /petstore/pets resource. Upon receiving a correct request, the backend adds the specified pet to the PetStore and returns the result to the caller. The integration is also HTTP. GET /pets/{petId}: for read access to a pet as identified by a petId value as specified as a path variable of the incoming request URL. The backend returns the specified pet found in the PetStore. The URL of the backend HTTP endpoint is http://petstore-demo-endpoint.execute-api.com/petstore/pets/n, where n is an integer as the identifier of the queried pet
